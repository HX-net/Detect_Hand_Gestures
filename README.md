# Detect_Hand_Gestures
You can increase or decrease the volume of your laptop with this code.
The user interface of the code is designed with the TKinter library.
After running the code, the first camera detected by the laptop will be opened and you will see that if you put your hand in the camera frame, all the joints of your hand will be detected and the tip of your index finger and thumb will turn blue. Then you can increase or decrease the volume by the distance between thumb and index finger.
